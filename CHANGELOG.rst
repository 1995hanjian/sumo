Change Log
==========

Notable changes are logged here by release. This project uses Semantic Versioning:

- Version numbers take the format X.Y.Z
- X is associated with major API breakage / changes in algorithm and results.
- Y is associated with updates and improvements
- Z is associated with bug fixes and small amounts of code tidying, refactoring and documentation

The changelog format is inspired by `keep-a-changelog <https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog>`_.
